# Short-url
A URL shortener redirects short URLs to long URLs
This project contain 2 projects: `Django` & `Django rest framework`

### Algorithm 
 - Encoding the url Id to `base62` including [a-z][A-Z][0-9] characters.
 
        Why not using Hash ? 
        MD5 hash will generate 128 bit and only take the first 7 bits 
        Therefor it doesnt generate unique id. 
 - Encoding length will be `7 digits long` *
 
       This will allow us generate 62^7 tokens ~ 3.5 billon  
 - To Create 7 digit long the id COUNTER will start from `10000000+1`  
 

### Scaling Architecture
    We can use a distributed service Zookeeper to solve the various challenges of a distributed system 
    like a race condition, deadlock, or particle failure of data.
    Every database take 10 mil ranges.
    For example: 
      Db1 ranges [100000001, 200000000]  
      Db2 ranges [200000001, 300000000] 
      
    In Case of failur we can replicate data of master to itâ€™s slave
    If one of the database reaches its maximum range we can create new database 
    and Zookeeper will assign an unused counter range to this new database.

### Tech Stack 
- Web pages: Python Django 
- Web API: Python Django rest freamwork 
- DB: Sqlite 
- Front: Html, Css, Bootsrap
- Docker-composer 

### Settings
- Located in `Settings.py` file.
- To change the initial server counter: `SERVER_ID_COUNTER  = 100000001`
- To change the defult url: `SERVER_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"`



### Build
Use Docker-Compose to spin up containers `docker-compose up`

### Main Routes
 - web route: `localhost:8000`
 - Api route: `localhost:8000/api`
